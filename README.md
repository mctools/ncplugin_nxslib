# NCrystal legacy plugin for loading .nxs files

This repository includes a plugin for [NCrystal](https://github.com/mctools/ncrystal/wiki) which can be used to load the .nxs files associated with [nxslib](http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S0021889812016056). Before NCrystal release v3.0.0, this plugin was included directly in the main NCrystal release. However, as the .nxs loading relies on 3rd party libraries under licenses (see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file) different from the main NCrystal license (which is the Apache-2.0 license), it was removed from the main NCrystal release and kept here as an optional standalone plugin for anyone needing it and willing to abide by those additional license terms.

To learn more about how to use this plugin with NCrystal, please visit the [Plugins](https://github.com/mctools/ncrystal/wiki/Plugins) page in the NCrystal wiki.
