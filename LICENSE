The NCrystal[1] plugin in this repository uses code from two third-party open
source C-libraries, nxslib[2] and SgInfo[3], which for convenience have all been
collected into just two files: NCNXSLib.hh and NCNXSLib.cc. Naturally, using
code from this plugin implies that the license requirements of both nxslib and
SgInfo have to be fulfilled (in addition to the Apache-2.0 license of NCrystal
itself of course). These requirements are included at the top of both
NCNXSLib.hh and NCNXSLib.cc and are also repeated here in this file (see below).

Other files in this plugin were written by the NCrystal developers and is
released under the same Apache 2.0 license as the rest of the NCrystal
files. Please refer to the general NOTICE and LICENSE files found at the root
directory of the NCrystal distribution for more information.

// This header and associated source file contain both the NXS Crystallography library (Mirko      //
// Boin, HZB) [nxslib] and the Space Group Info library (Ralf W. Grosse-Kunstleve) [SgInfo], with  //
// modifications by NCrystal developers (clearly marked by comments in the code and reachable by   //
// searching for "NCrystal"). The modifications include a few bug-fixes, but were mainly needed    //
// in order to be able to contain all of both nxslib and SgInfo sources in a single .hh/.cc file   //
// pair, compilable as C++ and protected by a namespace. Both nxslib and SgInfo sources were       //
// lifted from the NXSG4 distribution (http://cern.ch/nxsg4/), since they were both reproduced     //
// there with clear license text, repeated in the following:                                       //
