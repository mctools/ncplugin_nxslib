## NXS file autogenerated by NCrystal from input: "W_sg229.ncmat"
## The original input file had the following whole-line comments (beginning with "#") in it:
## #
## # Tungsten (W). BCC.
## #
## # Crystal structure was converted from the cif file of the entry 0011236 in the AMCSD.
## # Additional reference: Wyckoff R W G, Crystal Structures, vol. 1, p. 7-83, 1963.

## # The VDOS curve was extracted by T. Kittelmann using the engauge digitizer
## # software from Figure 2 of:
## #
## #   "Effect of the variation of the electronic density of states of zirconium and
## #    tungsten on their respective thermal conductivity evolution with temperature"
## #   Jean-Paul Crocombette et al 2015 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 27 165501
## #   https://doi.org/10.1088/0953-8984/27/16/165501
## #
## # It should be noted that Crocombette-2015 argues that VDOS curve is not perfect
## # at higher frequencies. If a more convincing VDOS curve is one day available,
## # the one below could be replaced. However, the realism of even a rough VDOS
## # curve is much better than the alternative of a Debye spectrum.
