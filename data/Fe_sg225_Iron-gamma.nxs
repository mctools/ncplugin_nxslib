## NXS file autogenerated by NCrystal from input: "Fe_sg225_Iron-gamma.ncmat"
## The original input file had the following whole-line comments (beginning with "#") in it:
## #
## # Gamma-iron (austenite, fcc Fe)
## #
## # In pure iron and at atmospheric pressure, the gamma phase of iron forms at
## # 1180K, but might exist at lower temperatures in impure alloys.
## #
## # Crystal structure (225, fcc) is well known and available from many
## # sources. The only parameter to determine is the lattice parameter, which affects
## # d-spacings and material density. We use the temperature-dependent
## # parameterisation found in (evaluated at 1300K):
## #
## #    "Lattice Constant of Iron and Austenite Including Its Supersaturation
## #     Phase of Carbon", Ichiro SEKI, Kazuhiro NAGATA,
## #     ISIJ International, 2005, Volume 45, Issue 12, Pages 1789-1794
## #     https://doi.org/10.2355/isijinternational.45.1789
